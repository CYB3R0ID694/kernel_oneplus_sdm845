This branch is a work-in-progress for adapting Illusion kernel to support crDroid 7 device trees for OnePlus 6/6T, in order to re-add DeviceSettings in place of lineage-sdk device-specific pieces, due to lack of LOS kernel support.

Also includes updated wireguard kernel support and updated linux-stable security patches from the kernel.org v4.9 LTS branch.
