## Hola amiguitos

This is a copy of 11.0-test-illusion1.5 branch (I should really learn to make "tags", because that's effectively what I'm doing with these), which was used for the March 2021 release of crDroid v7.4.

It's a work-in-progress for adapting Illusion kernel to support crDroid 7 device trees for OnePlus 6/6T, in order to re-add DeviceSettings in place of lineage-sdk device-specific pieces, due to lack of LOS kernel support.

Also includes updated wireguard kernel support and updated linux-stable security patches from the kernel.org v4.9 LTS branch (up to v4.9.261 as of this release).
